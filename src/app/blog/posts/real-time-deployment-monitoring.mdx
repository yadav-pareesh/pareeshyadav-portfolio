## Bridging the CMS and the Cloud

For **app.sleekcms.com**, users needed to know exactly when their site was live. We achieved this by integrating the **Netlify API**.

### Implementation

We set up a webhook listener that triggers a notification in the React frontend whenever the deployment status changes from `building` to `ready`.

<CodeBlock
    marginBottom="16"
    codes={[
  {
    code:
`const checkStatus = async (siteId) => {
  const { status } = await netlifyApi.getDeployStatus(siteId);
  if (status === 'ready') {
    showNotification({ title: 'Success', message: 'Site is live!' });
  }
};`,
    language: "tsx",
    label: "hooks/useDeployment.ts"
  }
]} />

This real-time feedback loop significantly improved user confidence in our static site builder.
