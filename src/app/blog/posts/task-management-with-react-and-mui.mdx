## Collaboration First

Building **Taskivities** required a deep focus on real-time state synchronization. As the lead engineer, my goal was to ensure that task updates were reflected for all team members without manual refreshes.

### UI Strategy with Material UI

We chose **Material UI** for its robust component set, which allowed us to build complex task boards with ease.

<CodeBlock
    marginBottom="16"
    codes={[
  {
    code:
`<Grid container spacing={2}>
  {tasks.map((task) => (
    <Grid item xs={12} md={4} key={task.id}>
      <TaskCard data={task} onStatusChange={updateTask} />
    </Grid>
  ))}
</Grid>`,
    language: "tsx",
    label: "components/TaskBoard.tsx"
  }
]} />

The result is a scalable, professional task manager that handles day-to-day collaboration for modern teams.
