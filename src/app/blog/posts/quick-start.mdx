## About

This portfolio is engineered to be more than just a static resume. It is a comprehensive, MDX-driven platform designed for speed, accessibility, and high SEO rankings. By combining the layout power of **Tailwind CSS** with the enterprise-grade components of **Mantine UI**, I've created a system that is both visually stunning and technically robust.

## Architecture

The site leverages a modular architecture where content is decoupled from the UI. By using MDX, I can write project case studies and blog posts in Markdown while embedding live React components directly into the text.



## Quick Start

If you are looking to set up a similar environment for a modern React project, follow these steps:

### 1. Initialize the Project
Clone the base repository structure:

<CodeBlock compact marginBottom="16" codes={[
  {
    code: "git clone https://github.com/pareesh-yadav/professional-portfolio.git",
    language: "bash"
  }
]} />

### 2. Install Dependencies
Ensure you have the latest versions of Mantine and Tailwind CSS installed:

<CodeBlock compact marginBottom="16" codes={[
  {
    code: "npm install @mantine/core @mantine/hooks @emotion/react tailwindcss",
    language: "bash"
  }
]} />

### 3. Configure the Theme
Set up your `tailwind.config.js` to work in harmony with Mantine's theme tokens to ensure a consistent dark and light mode experience.

### 4. Run Development Server
Start building your components with real-time hot reloading:

<CodeBlock compact marginBottom="16" codes={[
  {
    code: "npm run dev",
    language: "bash"
  }
]} />

## Why This Stack?

- **Mantine UI**: Provides complex hooks (like `use-media-query`) and polished components (Modals, Selects) out of the box.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Allows for rapid, "unnatural speed" when tweaking layouts and responsive designs.
- **MDX**: Gives me the flexibility to turn my technical notes into interactive blog posts without touching the core codebase.
