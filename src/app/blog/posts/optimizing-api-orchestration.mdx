## Managing Asynchronous State

When building data-heavy platforms like **SleekCMS**, managing multiple API calls—from content fetching to deployment status—is a significant challenge.

### Centralizing Requests

I use a centralized service layer to handle authentication headers and error logging. This ensures that every request follows a consistent pattern.

<CodeBlock
    marginBottom="16"
    codes={[
  {
    code:
`const apiService = async (endpoint, options = {}) => {
  const response = await fetch(\`\${process.env.API_BASE_URL}\${endpoint}\`, {
    ...options,
    headers: { 'Authorization': \`Bearer \${token}\` }
  });
  return response.json();
};`,
    language: "tsx",
    label: "services/api.ts"
  }
]} />



By implementing **Optimistic UI updates**, we ensure that the user experience remains snappy even during slow network conditions.
