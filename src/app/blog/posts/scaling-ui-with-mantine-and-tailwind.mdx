## The Hybrid Approach

In modern web development, choosing between a component library and a utility-first framework is a common dilemma. In my recent work, I've found that using **Mantine UI** for complex components (like DatePickers or Modals) and **Tailwind CSS** for layout and spacing provides the ultimate developer experience.

### Configuration

To ensure both libraries work in harmony without style conflicts, you can wrap your application in the `MantineProvider` and use Tailwind's `important` selector if necessary.

<CodeBlock
    marginBottom="16"
    codes={[
  {
    code:
`// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  content: ["./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}"],
  corePlugins: {
    preflight: false, // Prevents conflicts with Mantine's base styles
  },
};`,
    language: "javascript",
    label: "tailwind.config.js"
  }
]} />

This setup allows for "unnatural speed" when building complex dashboards.
