## Overview

[SleekCMS](https://www.sleekcms.com) is a high-performance headless CMS and static site generator designed to simplify content delivery. Working on [app.sleekcms.com](https://app.sleekcms.com), I focused on bridging the gap between distributed backend services and an intuitive administrative interface through robust API orchestration.

## Key Contributions

- **Complex API Integration & Orchestration**: Integrated a vast array of RESTful APIs to handle core CMS functionalities. This included connecting the frontend with backend services for content fetching, media uploads, and real-time data synchronization.
- **Third-Party Deployment Logic**: Developed the integration layer for hosting providers like **Netlify**. I implemented logic to trigger automated builds and monitor deployment statuses via webhooks and API calls directly from the CMS dashboard.
- **UI Overhaul with Mantine & Tailwind**: Rebuilt core interface modules using **Mantine UI** components combined with **Tailwind CSS**. This hybrid approach ensured high accessibility standards while maintaining a unique, sleek brand identity.
- **Dynamic Content Modeling Logic**: Refined the frontend logic for managing nested content models. I optimized the relationship mapping between content types, ensuring that the UI accurately reflects complex JSON schemas returned by the API.
- **Secure Data Handling**: Implemented secure API communication patterns, including token-based authentication and centralized error handling to manage rate-limiting and connection timeouts gracefully.

## Technologies Used

- **React & Axios/Fetch**: For managing asynchronous API requests and state synchronization.
- **Mantine UI**: Used for complex components like modals, notifications, and data tables.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For fine-grained control over the responsive layout and dark/light themes.
- **Postman**: For testing and documenting API endpoints during the integration phase.
- **Netlify API**: For managing site deployments and build triggers.

## Challenges and Learnings

One of the most significant challenges was managing the **asynchronous state** across the application. When integrating multiple APIs—such as fetching content entries while simultaneously checking deployment status—maintaining a "single source of truth" in the React state was critical. I implemented optimistic UI updates to ensure the application felt "snappy" even when waiting for backend confirmations. This experience solidified my expertise in building resilient, API-driven architectures.

## Outcome

The integration of these APIs turned SleekCMS into a truly "connected" platform. Users can now move from content creation to a live production site on Netlify with a single click, thanks to the seamless communication between the frontend, the CMS engine, and third-party services.
