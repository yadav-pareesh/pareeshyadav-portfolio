## Why Microservices?

Working at **Sleeksky**, I've realized that code duplication is the enemy of scalability. By moving shared logic into private **NPM packages**, we can maintain a single source of truth for our core business rules.

### Publishing a Shared Logic Package

The key is to use **TypeScript** for better developer experience and **GitHub Actions** for automated versioning and publishing.

<CodeBlock
    marginBottom="16"
    codes={[
  {
    code:
`{
  "name": "@sleeksky/core-logic",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "dist/index.js",
  "types": "dist/index.d.ts"
}`,
    language: "json",
    label: "package.json"
  }
]} />

This approach allows our team to update a single package and have those changes reflect across the entire Sleeksky ecosystem.
